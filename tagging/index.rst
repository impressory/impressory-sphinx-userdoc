Tagging
=======

When you add content to Impressory, you are encouraged to give it a topic. This helps, for instance, navigate from the presentation on version control, to the video, to the interactive exercise.  The tagging format for impressory is:

    `adjective` `noun` about `topic`.  

So for instance we might have a `Lecture` about `Kirchoff's Current Law`, and we might have an `Exercise` about `Kirchoff's curernt Law`. If you want to use the adjectives then you might have an `Examinable` `Exercise` about `Kirchoff's Current Law`.

Content can have more than one topic, and it can have more than one noun.  Often, the noun will already have been added for you -- Impressory knows for instance that YouTube videos are videos.

The reason for this tag format is that down the track we're going to want to do some more interesting things with your course. For instance, build a map of how the topics in your course relate to each other. Or statistics on the usage of the different kinds (nouns) of content (video, lecture, exercises, etc).
