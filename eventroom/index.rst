Interaction stream
==================

Imperssory courses have a live interaction stream. We'd call it a chat stream, but you can do more than just chat with it. It can be opened whether your looking at the newsfeed, content in the viewer, or on its own if you're using a small mobile device. 

This means that you can have a live interaction with your class on the main screen in the lecture theatre, that then continues when your students are back at home or in the library, chatting from the newsfeed.

If your content is a live video broadcast (such as YouTube Live or Google Hangouts), the interaction stream gives you a return channel where many students can chat, ask questions, and respond to polls in real-time, helping your class to be live and interactive even if the class size is in the thousands.

Asking questions
----------------

If a chat message starts "Q:", it is highlighted in orange. This is designed for use in large classes, as there can be a lively enough discussion that the questions need to be highlighted so that the teacher can see easily which comments they need to respond to.


Polls
-----

When a poll is open in the viewer, click "push to stream" to push the poll to the interaction stream. This is particularly helpful if you are giving a lecture and have a poll as part of your content sequence -- you can push the poll so that students can easily vote on it, and whenever you choose click the "results" tab on the poll to see the live results streaming in.

(Typically you'd leave just the question up for a while, before showing the live results, so that the students don't all just follow the crowd and vote for the most popular option.)
