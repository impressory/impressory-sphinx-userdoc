Enrolling students
==================

There are a number of different ways to enrol students and other staff into your course

Invites
-------

You can create invitation codes that users can paste into the "Use invite" box on the course cover page. Invites can be created with a variety of roles, so the code you give your fellow course staff will normally be different than the code you give your students
