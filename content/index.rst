Kinds of Content 
================

There are many different kinds of content entry that Impressory supports: Markdown pages, polls, web pages, YouTube videos, Google Slides, and more being added all the time.


Posts and Wiki pages (Markdown)
-------------------------------

Wiki pages in Impressory use `Markdown <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax>`_ notation.  This is a popular and simple notation, because it is both easy-to-read and easy-to-write. This is how this section might look in Markdown:

Video
-----

Video is supported through YouTube.  Just paste the YouTube URL or embed code into the "share something" box on the newsfeed.  Video renders both in the viewer and in the newsfeed.

This also means you can use Impressory to add interaction around a live broadcast. Embed the YouTube URL of a Google Hangout to broadcast the video, and use the chat stream (including [polls](polls.html) and all the other goodies) to interact with your online audience.


Embed the Web
-------------

Web pages (including all those online interactive exercises that are out there) can be added as content. 


Presentations
-------------

Presentations are supported through Google Slides.  Shortly we'll also add support for presentations written locally, using Reveal.js.


Content sequences
-----------------

During a lecture, you might want to progress seemlessly from one piece of content to another.  For instance, if you have a couple of presentations you want to queue after each other.  Content sequences allow you to do this.
